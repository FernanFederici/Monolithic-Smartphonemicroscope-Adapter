# Monolithic 3D printed Microscope Adapter for Smartphones

This device is supposed to help you adding a microscope to your cellphone. Initially it was designed for the Huawei P20 Pro - therfore the distances between LED and Lens are bound to this hardware design. In theory, every phone works. 
The core idea was to have the phone's torch used as the illumination for the microscope. The imaging path is based on this very nice [publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095330) and only needs a low-cost lens e.g. from an old cellphone.

***Features:***

- ~2-3 ¬µm resolution
- Very low cost
- Only one 3D printed part
- refocussing possible by a flexure bearing
- minimum number of additional parts
- ready for polarization microscopy 
- can host an LED for illuminating the sample
- No electronics necessary

***üì±Tested Devices*** 

*Huawei P20 Pro:*

- it offes a 3x magnification due to the larger focal length of the inbuild lens!


*Samsung Galaxy S8*

- we added a white light as a light source attached to an old phone charger


Other phones will also work. Eventually one has to adapt the CAD file to match the camera positio. Please file an issue. I'm happy to help! :-)

## Software

We rely on the Software "FreedCam" for Android phones. With this we can make use of the tele camera (3x optical zoom) from the Huawei P20.
You can find it in the [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=troop.com.freedcam&hl=de&gl=US) or in the github page [here](https://github.com/KillerInk/FreeDcam).

## üõ† Assemble the Microscope üî¨

I hope the assembly is more less self explanatory. 

Fix the lens with some "GUM" (blutek/poster fix..) if it wobbles
