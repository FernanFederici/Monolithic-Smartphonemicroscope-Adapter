# Monolithic 3D printed Microscope Adapter for Smartphones

This device is supposed to help you adding a microscope to your cellphone. Initially it was designed for the Huawei P20 Pro - therfore the distances between LED and Lens are bound to this hardware design. In theory, every phone works. 
The core idea was to have the phone's torch used as the illumination for the microscope. The imaging path is based on this very nice [publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095330) and only needs a low-cost lens e.g. from an old cellphone.

***Features:***

- ~2-3 µm resolution
- Very low ost
- Only one 3D printed part
- refocussing possible by a flexure bearing



## Software

We rely on the Software "FreedCam" for Android phones. With this we can make use of the tele camera (3x optical zoom) from the Huawei P20.

### Assemble the XY-stage 

These are more-less all components you would need for the XY-stage to operate. The Z-focus assembly is explained below

Fix the lens with some "GUM" if it wobbles

## License and Collaboration

This project is open-source and is released under the CERN open hardware license. Our aim is to make the kits commercially available.
We encourage everyone who is using our Toolbox to share their results and ideas, so that the Toolbox keeps improving. It should serve as a easy-to-use and easy-to-access general purpose building block solution for the area of STEAM education. All the design files are generally for free, but we would like to hear from you how is it going.

You're free to fork the project and enhance it. If you have any suggestions to improve it or add any additional functions make a pull-request or file an issue.
